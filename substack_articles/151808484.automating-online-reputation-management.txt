As I stated in my 
original article
 on online reputation management, having a poor online reputation for your business is like trying to make a solid first impression with someone with holes in your shoes, stains on your shirt, and bad breath. You might have a world-class product, but your 2.7-star rating on Trust Pilot, horrific feedback on Reddit, and a mountain of negative articles on Google are enough to scare away over 90% of potential buyers.
However, there are two hurdles to monitoring your brand’s online reputation effectively. The first is that many tools that do this only offer partial solutions, such as monitoring social media or websites, but rarely both. Second, many of these tools cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars monthly. Thankfully, using a combination of Clay, Chat-GPT, and Zapier, you can create a customized and automated reputation management system to track your and your competitors’ businesses.
Sample final report
In this article, I will explain how to do this and provide an example of a custom dashboard and report I built.
A final note before I jump in: if you see bolded words in this article or the accompanying Google doc, they are dynamic variables in the Clay table. Anyone not interested in reading the full article can find a summary

The Key Components of Online Reputation Management 
There are levels of complexity to online reputation management. Still, for my v1 table and report, I decided to track the following items:
Social Following
1). # of LinkedIn Followers
2). # of Facebook Followers
3). # of Instagram Followers
Company Ratings
4).
 
Glassdoor
 Rating—Glassdoor is an employee review site that enables you to see how your company is perceived by your workforce.
5). Google My Business (GMB) Rating - GMB is a customized page you can set up for your business. Users first see it when they Google “
Company Name Location
.” An example of a GMB page for Magic Spoon can be found below. I found this page by Googling “Magic Spoon Cereal New York.”
Company Reviews
6). Summary of Reviews on Google Search Results - Feedback from top listings on Google search.
7). % Net Positive Reviews—This tells us the percentage of a product’s favorable online reviews.
8). Top 3 Product Criticisms from Google Search Result Reviews - Criticisms from top listings on Google search.
While this is a solid starting list, I intend to create a v2 table and report that includes two additional pieces of information: reviews about a brand on 
Reddit
 and 
YouTube
. For those unfamiliar with Reddit, it is a wildly popular social media platform that serves as a hub for diverse communities and discussions. 
74% of Redditors
 say, “Reddit is where I challenge my thinking and views.” Reddit communities like r/buyitforlife have close to 2 million subscribers. As for YouTube, a 2016 study found that 
68% of YouTube users
 watched YouTube to help make a purchase decision.
Using Clay to Track Social Following  
Now that we are clear on what we are trying to build, I will show you how to use Clay and Chat-GPT to create a dynamic table and then Zapier to make a report you can share with your wider team. The first item on the list is tracking social following (specifically, the number of Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn followers). I used Clay’s built-in AI agent, Claygent, to find all three of these. 
Here
 are the prompts I used to smoothly pull in the follower counts from the relevant platforms.

Using Clay to Track Company Ratings 
Next, we are going to use Clay to track company ratings (specifically, the company’s Glassdoor rating and GMB rating). I used Claygent to find the company’s Glassdoor rating. 
Here
 are the prompts I used to accomplish this.
Finding the proper rating for a company’s GMB page is trickier for a few reasons. First, not every company has a GMB page; it must be consciously created. Second, many companies have similar names, and despite Clay having a direct GMB integration, if you are not careful, you will either miss the company’s GMB page or accidentally pull in the GMB page for the wrong company.
Clay’s built-in Google My Business integration
Here are the steps I took to ensure I pulled in the right GMB page and, thus, the correct GMB rating:
#1 - Use Clay’s “Domain” integration to find the company URLs for each company.
#2 - I used Claygent to find each company's headquarters. This is crucial since actually finding a GMB page requires a location search on Google. Try searching “Magic Spoon Cereal,” and no GMB page is returned. Instead, search “Magic Spoon Cereal New York,” and the page will come up. I used Claygent to find the company headquarters, and the prompts that I used to do this can be found 
here
.
#3 - Next, we are going to use Clay’s GMB integration (pictured above) with the following inputs:
Company Name: 
Company Name
Company Website: 
Domain
Company Address: 
Company Headquarters
#4 - This will return a GMB page, but our work is not done yet. Some of these results are wildly off-base (as the image below shows). Consequently, we need to use Claygent to determine which results are accurate and which are fake. The prompts that I used to do this can be found 
here
.
#5 - It is finally time to separate the wheat from the chaff. We are going to create a “Formula” column using the “AI Formula Generator” with the following command:
If 
Profile Legitimacy 
is equal to “Yes,” then please copy 
Rating. 
Otherwise, please write “NA.”
This final command does the trick, and we now have a foolproof column, “Final GMB Rating.”
Using Clay to Track Company Reviews
For the Summary of Reviews on Google Search Results, I first used Clay’s Chat-GPT 4o integration to find the URLs for all product review pages. The prompts I used to do this can be found 
here
. This gave me a list of URLs like the following:
1. https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8071288/magic-spoon-low-carb-high-protein-cereal-review/
2. https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/magic-spoon-cereal-review/
3. https://medium.com/@timothy.dpulliam/an-honest-review-of-magic-spoon-cereal-fdbc099ca481
Next, I used Clay’s Chat-GPT 4o integration to review the text on each webpage and determine whether it is a positive, neutral, or negative review of the product. The prompts I used to do this can be found 
here
.
The “Summary of Reviews on Google Search Results” value is created which we can pull out from the “Review Analysis” prompts that we did above. The summary is Chat-GPTs reasoning as to why it classified the various URLs as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
Summary of reviews on Google Search
Now that we have a count of how many articles are Positive, Negative, or Neutral, I can use Clay’s Formula capabilities to find the % Net Positive Reviews. First, I create a counter and start it at 0. Next, do +1 for all Positive reviews and -1 for all Negative reviews, and then divide the total by the result by the total number of reviews. For example, if four reviews are Positive, 2 Negative, and 2 Neutral, the final result is 25% ( (4 - 2) / 8). Below is an example of what this looks like. All I had to do here was fill out the “Describe the formula you want” section, and Clay did the rest.

Finally, I want to find the Top 3 Product Criticisms. I used Clay’s Chat-GPT integration and created prompts 
here
 to do this. These produced three criticisms for each product based on the reviews I could then pull into its own column.

Creating a Custom Report with Zapier 
We now have all of the values we want for our company and our closest competitors. As a final step, we will use Zapier to create a custom Google Docs report. The process for doing this has already been well outlined in 
this article
, so instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, I will share the field mapping I did in Clay (below) and the end output (
here
). The beautiful thing about this is that it’s a one-and-done solution. Now that my table is created, I can input a new company name, run my fields, and within 1 minute or less, I will have a custom report completed for me.
Conclusion
In conclusion, creating a comprehensive online reputation management system doesn’t have to be expensive or limited by the constraints of pre-packaged tools. By leveraging the power of Clay, ChatGPT, and Zapier, businesses can automate the monitoring and reporting of their brand’s online presence with precision and cost-efficiency. This customized approach not only provides actionable insights into social following, ratings, and reviews but also lays a strong foundation for enhancing brand credibility and consumer trust.
