What if your best salesperson never slept, predicted your customer’s next move, and responded to customer inquiries within seconds? The rules of selling are changing fast, and those who harness AI will come out on top. A 
Harvard Business Review
 study on SAP found that by leveraging AI, they were able to produce a 55% improvement in sales performance, close 3.6 times more deals than their peers, and make deals that are 516% larger than those of their peers. In this article, I will dive into how AI is poised to transform the sales industry and some innovative companies leading the charge. Anyone not interested in reading the full article can find a summary with all of the critical points

The Current State of Sales 
Almost all sales organizations currently use one of 
three models
: The Island Model, The Pod Model, or The Assembly Line model. Most startups or SaaS businesses use The Assembly Line Model and follow a 
7-step sales process
 as shown below.

While this process has worked adequately for decades, there are some issues with it that AI can help to address:
1). Time Wasted on Non-Revenue Generating Activities: 
A 
study
 of over 720 sales reps revealed that nearly two-thirds (64.8%) of rep’s time, on average, is spent on non-revenue-generating activities, leaving only 35.2% for functions related to selling.
2). 
Slow Speed to Lead: 
Speed to Lead is the average time your organization takes to respond to a qualified prospect from the moment they become an inbound lead. A 
study
 by Harvard Business School found that firms that tried to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving a query were nearly 7x as likely to qualify the lead as those that tried to contact the customer even an hour later and 60x as likely as companies that waited 24 hours or longer. The kicker? The average response time of companies in the study was 42 hours.

3). 
Personalization: 
Only 
13% of businesses
 are currently personalizing the sales experience, lagging far behind customer service (49.5%) and marketing (21.1%). 
Research
 from McKinsey has found that companies that excel at personalization generate 40 percent more revenue from those activities than average players.
4). Sales Coaching and Training:
 A study by The Brooks Group found that 45% of sales managers only spend 30-60 minutes per week training sales reps. This is concerning since 
McKinsey
 found that leading organizations are twice as likely to customize training according to specific sales roles.
How AI Can Minimize Wasted Time
Building lists of relevant prospects can often be time-consuming and frustrating. However, 
RB2B
 streamlines this process by identifying anonymous website visitors and pushing their LinkedIn profiles to Slack or your CRM in real time. Additionally, tools like 
Phantombuster
 allow you to scrape lists of prospects who engage with your company’s or competitors’ LinkedIn posts. Chatbots, such as 
Drift
, enhance the sales pipeline on the customer support side by offering immediate assistance and guiding leads efficiently. Companies like 
Scheduler AI
 further simplify operations by using natural language processing to manage scheduling requests, suggest optimal meeting times, and automate rescheduling when needed.
AI-powered CRMs, including 
Salesforce’s Einstein
 and 
Zoho CRM
, take automation to the next level by eliminating routine tasks like data entry and lead management. These CRMs analyze data from customer interactions and purchase history to uncover upselling and cross-selling opportunities. AI also enhances communication by summarizing calls accurately within moments of completion and automatically emailing summaries and next steps to participants—
Sybill
 and 
Momentum
 excel in this area. For presentations, tools like 
Slides AI
 speed up the creation of high-quality decks, while 
Storydoc’s
 AI proposal generator produces interactive, personalized proposals by pulling data directly from CRMs and applying brand-specific colors and visuals.

How AI Can Improve Speed to Lead
One of the biggest challenges to speed-to-lead is the reliance on manual handoffs and human labor, which can slow down response times. AI offers solutions to streamline this process. Companies like 
Bluebird
 automate lead routing, instantly connecting leads to the most appropriate sales rep. 
Tray AI
 ensures timely engagement by triggering automated, personalized follow-up messages, keeping leads engaged even when sales reps are occupied. Additionally, 
MadKudu
 leverages AI and machine learning for predictive lead scoring, enabling sales teams to focus on the most promising prospects and allocate resources more effectively.
AI frees you up to handle all your other priorities 
How AI Can Improve Personalization
While humans strive to personalize outreach, AI enables personalization at an unprecedented scale. Companies like 
Outreach.io
 lead the way by offering personalized email sequences, content recommendations, and machine learning to optimize the timing and messaging of outreach efforts. 
Prezant AI
 streamlines the creation of hyper-personalized, on-brand presentations tailored to every client in the pipeline. Similarly, 
Clay
 uses AI to craft highly personalized emails to prospects based on their LinkedIn profiles, data about them that is publicly accessible on the web, and data you have captured in your CRM system.

How AI Can Improve Training and Coaching 
Training and coaching are often among the first activities to be neglected with the demands of day-to-day obligations, especially personalized coaching, which requires time and careful attention to each team member’s strengths and weaknesses. Fortunately, AI solutions are addressing these challenges in several ways.
Gong
 uses AI to capture and analyze customer interactions, generate call summaries, highlight key discussion points, and provide quantitative performance scores. 
Quantified
 offers a sales simulator with custom AI avatars trained on your company’s products and messaging, grading each simulation against a personalized rubric to align with your sales goals. Meanwhile, 
Dialpad
 provides real-time live coaching by delivering talking points triggered by specific keywords during conversations and alerting reps if they need to slow down, reduce filler words, or improve listening, enabling immediate course correction.

What Will the Future of Sales Look Like?
You have created a robust list of “cold prospects” to target using LinkedIn Sales Navigator and uploaded them to your Salesforce CRM. You use 
Clay
 to create highly personalized outreach messages to these prospects based on data pulled straight from their LinkedIn profiles and then automate outreach to them using 
Lemlist
. Anyone visiting your website or commenting on your LinkedIn company’s posts is automatically identified using RB2B or Phantombuster, added to your Clay table, and then given a lead score to see if they match your ICP. If so, they are automatically sent to Lemlist and added to a “warm prospects” flow, after which they start receiving emails.
Anyone who responds to the email will be encouraged to sign up for a short product demo, with 
Bluebird
 instantly connecting them to the best rep and 
Scheduler AI
 suggesting ideal times to connect. The sales rep will prepare a speedy but personalized presentation using 
Prezant AI
 and be ready for the call, having done multiple training simulations with 
Quantified
’s avatars. On the call, the sales rep will get real-time feedback from 
Dialpad
. It won’t have to worry about taking notes or logging action items since 
Gong.io
 will be handling both in the background.
After the call, the sales rep will complete a proposal in record time using 
Salesdoc
 and will ultimately close the deal. All the sales steps above will be automatically tracked by 
Salesforce Einstein
, which will also help to identify cross-selling and up-selling opportunities once the client has fully onboarded with your Customer Success Team.

Conclusion
The sales industry has already undergone massive changes because of AI, and these changes will surely accelerate in the future. While change can be scary for some, the consensus among many thought leaders is that AI is much more likely to change sales roles and allow for greater focus on high-leverage activities versus deleting roles entirely. In the end, I think it will be a positive development with considerable boosts in productivity, even if there are a few bumps along the way.
