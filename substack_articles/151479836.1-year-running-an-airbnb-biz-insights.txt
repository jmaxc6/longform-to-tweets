I took a deep breath and slowly twisted the door handle, bracing for the worst. But, what greeted me upon entry was far more heinous than anything I could have ever imagined. Red hair dye was splattered all over our formerly pristine white couch. Broken glass and chicken feathers clogged our kitchen drain. Our fridge was packed with tubs of animal lard and coated in dried blood. Our storage cabinet had been smashed with an axe, and hundreds of dollars of house supplies were stolen. Our backyard had a mountain of trash bags piled so high you would be forgiven for thinking it was the local landfill. I took the longest sigh of my life, pulled myself together, and began the cleanup from hell.
How did I end up in this mess? It all started five months earlier when my girlfriend and I decided to find a side hustle to make some extra income. We both had been following some entrepreneurship and side hustle accounts on Instagram (Nick Huber and Codie Sanchez being two of the most prominent). We had been seeking out a project we could work on together. We explored every conceivable option: buying a laundromat, creating a vending machine business, renting our car on Turo, renting photo booths for weddings, creating a self-storage business, and more. Based on our research, none of these options seemed particularly compelling, and any financial upside also came with significant risk. However, one idea that appealed to us from the get-go was real estate, notably Airbnb.
They make it look so easy…
My girlfriend was open to real estate because her parents had made a solid return from a long-term rental they had owned for years. I leaned towards Airbnb because I had several friends in New York who had been doing it for years and made a ton of money. So, when I was browsing Instagram and came across a promo on my Explore page for a “free webinar on profiting from Airbnb,” it piqued my interest. Preston Seo, a well-known Airbnb influencer with close to 1 million followers, offered the webinar. I attended the webinar more out of curiosity than anything else and with little desire to pay for an Airbnb course. However, the content was clear, comprehensive, and convincing. Before the seminar wrapped up, I had dropped over $1k on the “Airbnb Arbitrage Roadmap” course. Airbnb arbitrage was simple: pay a landlord monthly rent, convince them to let you rent out the property on Airbnb for shorter stays, and profit off the spread between the two.
Was I convinced I would effortlessly build an Airbnb empire and make a killing? No. I knew that real estate and Airbnb, in particular, had a steep learning curve and would require much effort, but I was ready to go all in and commit myself to the process. It has been about a year since my girlfriend and I launched our Airbnb business. In this article, I want to share five valuable lessons I learned.

#1 - Since 2020, Airbnb has witnessed a massive crackdown
The overwhelming message in the “Airbnb Arbitrage Roadmap” course was, “There are hundreds of fantastic markets for Airbnb and a clear-cut process on how to identify them.” My girlfriend and I used a software tool, AirDNA, to get in-depth insights into various markets and identify a few we thought were sure winners. Given our mutual desire to move fast and take action, we decided to cold call a few real estate agents in the Las Vegas area one Thursday night to pitch them on the Airbnb arbitrage concept.
After a few missed calls, I finally got an agent on the phone. As I was taught, I told him I “was a real estate investor looking to lease a property and then sublease it on Airbnb.” While I was relieved he let me finish my entire pitch, his immediate answer was, “Sorry, the HOA does not allow short-term rentals.” I thought this was a fluke, but after another 15-20 cold calls to various markets, I noticed a repeated pattern of the rejections we were getting. “The city has banned new Airbnb,” “Airbnb is only permitted if you own the property,” and “My part of town is not zoned for Airbnb; good luck.”
I started learning about initiatives like this to shutdown Airbnb
As I went back to the drawing board and did further research, I learned that since 2020, a vast number of neighborhoods, cities, and states have put massive restrictions around Airbnb and that the number of places that allow new Airbnbs is now far less than those who have restricted it. It took 20-30 more hours of research to identify potentially profitable markets that allowed Airbnb. Through this process, my girlfriend and I settled on Scottsdale, AZ, as the market we wanted to go after. The primary reasons for Scottsdale are that it was ranked as a strong market on AirDNA with booming demand, it had a lot of large standalone homes (a big plus highlighted in the course), and I knew from research that AZ leadership was amenable to short-term rentals.
#2 - There are a ton of headaches and challenges with running an Airbnb business
On a single day, my girlfriend and I made around 20 cold calls to various realtors and landlords in Scottsdale, AZ. Around the end of this calling spree, I got in touch with Ann-Marie, a real estate agent who oversaw multiple Scottsdale properties and had no problem with us renting out her place on Airbnb. We booked a 12-hour trip from New York City to Scottsdale, checked out 3 different properties, and locked a property down for a year-long lease by the end of the week. We traveled to Scottsdale for a week in early December and spent nearly 60 hours furnishing our 4-bedroom, 3-bath place. It was a herculean effort, but by the end of the trip, we felt we had done a fantastic job, and our place had a good chance to stand out on Airbnb. We listed the property a few days later and were ready for the bookings to roll in.

For the next 1.5 weeks, it was crickets. A few property views but no bookings made us terrified that we would go the entire month of December with $0 in revenue. But, around the 17th of December, we were thrown what felt like a huge lifeline: a guest on VRBO (another booking site) booked for nearly 3 weeks, giving us our first taste of success; we were ecstatic. We heard very little from our guests during the first week of the stay and figured they were having a smooth and enjoyable trip. That is until my girlfriend anxiously approached me during my work day and said, “Something is weird. Can we talk?” We had installed a camera on our front door, enabling us to see guests coming in and out, and this supposed party of 4 had 15+ guests coming in and out of the house at all hours of the day. They also appeared to be dressed in traditional garb, with women wearing long flowing floral dresses and portly men wearing thick and bushy beards. “Don’t worry,” I said. “The main guest already promised me he would not throw any parties, and as long as they don’t mess up our place, it should be fine.”
Only after the guests left did my cleaning crew frantically call me and tell me about our place’s horrific state (as described in the introduction). This required me to make a multi-day trip to Scottsdale, AZ, to sort things out. I learned later, after some online sleuthing, that our guests were Gypsies who lived in the UK and who had a reputation for remorselessly wrecking rental properties. Through some heavy coercion, I got $500 back from them, but this was not worth the stress, cost, and effort to clean up the mess. While this was the worst situation, there were many other hiccups. Persistent issues with the heating and cooling system, guests who stole or broke items in our home, problems with our intelligent and manual locks, and more. Airbnb is not a “set it and forget it” business.
This was far better than what we dealt with…
#3 - Airbnb arbitrage is a crappy business model
I know some people might fight me tooth and nail on this one and argue they are making a killing with Airbnb arbitrage, but I personally don’t buy it. My girlfriend and I consider ourselves savvy operators with good business instincts, and I have built a
 seven-figure business
 from scratch. Despite all that, we found it incredibly hard to profit.
As part of the “Airbnb Arbitrage Roadmap” course, we were added to a 
Skool
 community with other group members. While I found many of them kind and earnest, I got the impression in every conversation I had in the group that as lost as I felt, all of them were at least 5 steps behind. Many members admitted to me privately that they were struggling to break even and were losing money most months. All the members I talked to who I sensed were making a legitimately good return were not following the Airbnb arbitrage model.
I learned that Airbnb, like many marketplaces, is governed by a power law distribution. A few properties, often run by professional management companies or Airbnb veterans, make huge returns, while most lose money. To have a real crack at competing against the heavy hitters, you must invest a ton of money (often upwards of $100k) to make your place exceptional. These updates include things like building a mini movie theater in your home, decking out your kitchen with Italian marble, or getting a professional landscaper to install high-quality turf in your backyard. If you own the property outright, these investments are palatable since they boost your monthly rents and your property value. But if you are renting the property with the intent of sub-leasing it on Airbnb? Good luck keeping up.

#4 - Details will make or break your business 
One of the things in the Skool community that I found persistently irritating was the group messaging. Preston Seo, the community leader, would regularly post laudatory posts celebrating member’s wins, such as, “Joe has launched a beautiful-looking property that should do a hefty $3k/month in profit, according to AirDNA. Congrats!” These posts would be met with tremendous fanfare by the broader community as if success was a lock and it was only a matter of time before the property manager made millions. However, when I checked in with these people months later, many expressed frustration at how things were going, felt they were the only ones struggling, and were embarrassed to seek help from the community.
This story repeated so many times that I finally snapped and did a post in the group titled, “Is anyone profitable post-launch?” venting my frustrations. This post was met with a flood of replies, with other group members saying, “I feel the same way,” “Things have been tough,” “I’m not making any money,” etc. While this thread got considerable engagement, it was basically ignored by Preston and the other group leaders, who continued to churn out success-porn posts totally disconnected from reality.
My frustrations embodied in meme-form
Only after some reflection did I realize the disconnect: the leadership’s message was that we were “real estate investors” when we were actually small business owners. Multiple modules in the course emphasized that it was crucial to choose the right market, and this could be make or break. Still, they under-emphasized how small details in how you run your business are the most significant difference between success and failure. While I felt like my girlfriend and I did a solid job of operating our Airbnb business, if I’m being brutally honest, there are a few areas of improvement that could have stacked up to some big wins:
-With more assertive negotiation, we could have dropped the rent by $300 / month, saving $3.6k / year.
-I do not think we were proactive enough about adjusting prices during the busy season. If we had taken action daily instead of every 2-3 days, we could have earned another $2k-$3k.
-When the season slowed down, I do not think we acted swiftly enough in seeking out a tenant for a mid-term rental. Had we been more decisive, we probably could have saved $5k.
#5 - You need to find and play your edge
Every person I met who succeeded in Airbnb (or in real estate more broadly) cultivated an edge and became adept at exploiting it. They may have 10 years of real estate experience and access to off-market deals. They may have experience in construction or construction management, enabling them to do home improvements well below market rate. They may be doing Airbnb under the table in illegal markets enabling them to generate much higher returns (I learned this was the key to a lot of the Airbnb success of my New York friends).
Or you could just be handsome and create a reality TV show
Often, it takes time to gain an edge. You may take some hits and fail for a few years until you gain solid experience and identify a profitable strategy. However, you cannot make serious money in real estate without an edge.
Conclusion
In conclusion, while diving into the Airbnb world seemed like an exciting venture full of potential, the reality proved to be far more challenging and nuanced than the “success stories” that initially inspired us. Our experience taught us that Airbnb arbitrage is far from a guaranteed moneymaker—it’s a business that demands constant attention, meticulous planning, and an ability to manage the unexpected. From navigating complex market restrictions to dealing with problematic guests, every step was a reminder that short-term rentals are not as passive as they might seem.
Do I regret having had this experience? No. I learned a lot about real estate, Airbnb, and tax and legal strategies. That said, I would never do an Airbnb arbitrage again and would only invest in long-term rentals moving forward.
